### About Me 🌐
Blending a strong statistical background with machine learning expertise, I transform complex data into impactful AI solutions. [cite_start]Currently pursuing my **M.S. in Data Science at NYU**[cite: 6], I am passionate about **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Multi-agent Systems**, and the intersection of **Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence**. 

[cite_start]With a dual foundation in **Statistics and Psychology** from UC Davis[cite: 8], I bring a unique analytical perspective to modeling human-like reasoning and behavior in AI systems.
